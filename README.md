# TTK4190-Guidance_and_Control_of_Vehicles

A collection of assignments and project performed in the course TTK4190 - Guidance and Control of Vehicles of fall 2018 at NTNU.

Mathematical modeling and simulation of vehicles in 6 degrees of freedom. This includes mathematical modeling of ship, semi-submersibles, aircraft, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Introduction to aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and sealoads as well as mathematical modeling of the environment (waves, ocean currents and wind). Kinematics (Euler angles and quaternions), transformations, rotation matrices, geographical and body-fixed coordinates systems, rigid-body kinetics and vectorial mechanics.

Methods for design and implementation of guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems for marine craft and aircraft. This includes simulation and testing of motion control systems during failure situations and for varying environmental loads. Emphasis is placed on classical guidance systems included line-of-sight (LOS) methods and path planning. Applied control theory and synthesis in terms of linear quadratic optimal control and state estimation (Kalman filtering), nonlinear observer theory, PID control with extensions to nonlinear systems, Lyapunov methods, sliding mode control, feedback linearization, backstepping designs and passivity-based methods. Autopilot design, dynamic positioning, attitude stabilization, roll damping, altitude and depth autopilots, vibration damping, sensor and navigation systems and wave filtering. Observers for integration of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and inertial measurements (gyros and accelerometers).

Work Performed by Sondre Aleksander Bergum, Martin Madsen, Ada Larsen and Anders Haver Vagle.

Assignment 1 is about Kinematics and Kinetics, Attitude Control of Satellite and Straight-line path following in the horizontal plane.

Assignment 2 designs an Aircraft Autopilot with State Estimation.

Assignment 3 designs Autopilots for Path Following/Tracking.
